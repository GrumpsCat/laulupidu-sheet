        <!-- NEW ASD SUMMARY -->
        <p>
        This study examined whether parental reports of sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) correspond to objective physiological sleep differences and whether these sleep patterns relate to daytime behavior. Fifty-eight children (ages 4–10) completed two nights of simultaneous actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG) along with standardized sleep and behavioral assessments. ASD “poor sleepers,” as rated by parents, showed significantly longer sleep latency and greater sleep fragmentation, along with reduced sleep efficiency and increased wake after sleep onset on actigraphy. These children also exhibited higher levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and repetitive/compulsive behaviors, with fragmentation correlating strongly with ritualistic and restrictive behaviors. Results demonstrate that parental sleep concerns reliably map onto quantifiable sleep phenotypes, positioning PSG and actigraphy as complementary methods for defining sleep dysfunction and guiding targeted interventions.

        <!-- ORIGINAL PARKINSON'S SUMMARY -->
        <p>
        This article proposes that Parkinson’s disease (PD) results not only from dopamine loss and α-synuclein pathology, but from a fundamental failure to maintain separation between sleep and wake states. PD is reframed as a pathological “superposition” in which REM-like features—such as muscle atonia, dream-like cognition, and autonomic instability—intrude into wakefulness, while wake-like activity disrupts normal sleep. Sustained cortical overactivation destabilizes sleep–wake circuitry, forming a vicious cycle of mixed states. A secondary loop involving impaired glymphatic clearance and neuroinflammation accelerates degeneration. This model explains PD’s motor, cognitive, and autonomic symptoms as consequences of chronic hybrid states and suggests that restoring sleep architecture may slow progression.
