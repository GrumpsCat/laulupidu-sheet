    <!-- Column 1 -->
    <div class="column">

        <p><strong>Glymphatic Clearance</strong> – A waste-removal system in the central nervous system that uses perivascular pathways to clear metabolic byproducts during sleep, facilitated by glial cells and cerebrospinal fluid flow.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Nigra and α-Synuclein</strong> – Refers to the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure involved in dopamine production, and α-synuclein, a presynaptic neuronal protein whose misfolding and aggregation are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Brainstem Autonomy</strong> – The capacity of brainstem nuclei to independently regulate essential physiological functions such as respiration, heart rate, arousal, reflexes, and sleep–wake transitions.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Dream-Like Cognition</strong> – A mode of thought characterized by vivid imagery, associative reasoning, and reduced logical constraint, resembling the mental activity experienced during REM sleep.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>REM Atonia</strong> – A paralysis-like state occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in which skeletal muscles become temporarily inactive to prevent the physical acting out of dreams.</p>
        <hr>

    </div>

    <!-- Column 2 -->
    <div class="column">

        <p><strong>Arousal Systems (Reticular Activating System)</strong> – A network of brainstem structures that regulate wakefulness, attention, and overall cortical activation through widespread projections to the cerebral cortex.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Cholinergic Modulation</strong> – Neural signaling involving the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which influences attention, learning, REM sleep generation, and arousal through both cortical and subcortical pathways.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Dopaminergic Signaling</strong> – Communication between neurons using the neurotransmitter dopamine, essential for motor control, reward processing, motivational behavior, and several cognitive functions.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Autonomic Regulation</strong> – Control of involuntary physiological processes such as heart rate, digestion, respiration, and vascular tone through the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Synaptic Homeostasis</strong> – The maintenance of stable synaptic strength across neural networks, often associated with sleep-related processes that rebalance synaptic activity after waking experience.</p>
        <hr>

    </div>

    <!-- Column 3 -->
    <div class="column">

        <p><strong>Cortical Arousal</strong> – The activation level of the cerebral cortex, influencing alertness, sensory processing, cognitive readiness, and responsiveness to environmental stimuli.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Thalamocortical Rhythm</strong> – Oscillatory activity generated through interactions between the thalamus and cortex, underlying consciousness, sensory gating, sleep stages, and attentional states.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Sleep Architecture</strong> – The structure and progression of sleep stages, including non-REM and REM sleep cycles, typically represented through a hypnogram across the night.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>REM–NREM Cycling</strong> – The alternation between REM sleep and non-REM sleep stages during a typical sleep period, regulated by coordinated activity in brainstem and hypothalamic circuits.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Neuroinflammation</strong> – Immune activation within the central nervous system involving microglia, astrocytes, and cytokines, often occurring in response to injury, infection, or neurodegenerative processes.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Circadian Entrainment</strong> – The synchronization of the body's internal biological clock to external environmental cues such as light, temperature, or social activity.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Basal Ganglia Circuitry</strong> – Interconnected nuclei including the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra that coordinate movement, action selection, and procedural learning.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Locus Coeruleus Activity</strong> – Noradrenergic signaling originating from the locus coeruleus, influential in arousal, stress responses, attention, and sleep–wake regulation.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Hypothalamic Sleep Switch</strong> – A set of hypothalamic neurons, including the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), that act as a regulatory mechanism controlling the transition between sleep and wakefulness.</p>
        <hr>
