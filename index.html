        This article proposes that Parkinson’s disease (PD) results not only from dopamine loss and α-synuclein pathology, but from a fundamental failure to maintain separation between sleep and wake states. PD is reframed as a pathological “superposition” in which REM-like features—such as muscle atonia, dream-like cognition, and autonomic instability—intrude into wakefulness, while wake-like activity disrupts normal sleep. Sustained cortical overactivation destabilizes sleep–wake circuitry, forming a vicious cycle of mixed states. A secondary loop involving impaired glymphatic clearance and neuroinflammation accelerates degeneration. This model explains PD’s motor, cognitive, and autonomic symptoms as consequences of chronic hybrid states and suggests that restoring sleep architecture may slow progression.
