        This study examined whether parental reports of sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) correspond to objective physiological sleep differences and whether these sleep patterns relate to daytime behavior. Fifty-eight children (ages 4–10) completed two nights of simultaneous actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG) along with standardized sleep and behavioral assessments. ASD “poor sleepers,” as rated by parents, showed significantly longer sleep latency and greater sleep fragmentation, along with reduced sleep efficiency and increased wake after sleep onset on actigraphy. These children also exhibited higher levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and repetitive/compulsive behaviors, with fragmentation correlating strongly with ritualistic and restrictive behaviors. Results demonstrate that parental sleep concerns reliably map onto quantifiable sleep phenotypes, positioning PSG and actigraphy as complementary methods for defining sleep dysfunction and guiding targeted interventions.
